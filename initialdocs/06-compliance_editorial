# PepTalk — Compliance & Editorial Policy

## Boundaries
- Educational content only. No medical advice. No “should,” “recommend,” “dosage,” “take,” “buy,” or vendor links.
- Protocols are reported verbatim from studies and clearly labelled “reported, not recommended.”
- Regulatory notes are descriptive (“status appears X per source Y”), not advisory.

## Disclaimers (display at top of every page)
> Educational summary. Not medical advice. We do not recommend usage, dosing, or sourcing. All claims are derived from cited studies or trial records.

## Editorial Standards
- Every empirical claim cites a PMID or NCT inline.
- Human vs animal evidence always distinguished.
- Safety sections highlight adverse events, contraindication signals, and uncertainties.

## Review Workflow
1) Automated checks (regex + link presence for PMID/NCT).
2) Model compliance pass (separate model from synthesis).
3) Human approval (quick read) before publish.

## Corrections
- Maintain a public changelog with timestamps and a brief reason for updates.

## Legal/Regulatory Notes
- Maintain high-level status (UK/EU/US) with citations to official sources where available. If unclear, say “unclear/varies by jurisdiction.”
