# PepTalk — Product Vision

## Problem
Peptide information online is noisy, inconsistent, and often promotional. People need a credible, structured reference with transparent sourcing.

## Solution
A living, peptide-focused evidence index:
- Structured pages per peptide with **evidence grade**, **human vs animal** counts, **studied protocols (reported, not recommended)**, **safety**, **regulatory lens**, and **live bibliography**.
- Weekly “what changed” digest from PubMed/ClinicalTrials.gov.
- Downloadable PDFs per page.

## Users
- Curious, informed consumers; coaches/clinics seeking quick evidence checks; researchers needing fast orientation.

## Differentiation
- Peptides-only. Citation-first. Deterministic ingestion from public registries. No vendor links. No recommendations.

## Scope (MVP)
- 20 peptide pages, search + filters, PDF export, weekly update feed, basic subscription.

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- No dosage recommendations, no sourcing/buy links, no forums or UGC.

## Pricing (provisional)
- Annual subscription with a free sample page and public weekly changelog.

## Naming & Tone
- “PepTalk” (working name). Neutral, clinical voice. No hype words. Prominent disclaimer on every page.
