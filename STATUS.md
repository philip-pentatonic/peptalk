# PepTalk — Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-04
**Current Phase:** Implementation Phase - Research Pipeline Complete
**Progress:** 85% Complete (MVP Ready)

---

## Overview

PepTalk is a citation-first peptide evidence reference platform. We're building a system that ingests research from PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, synthesizes it using Claude 4.5, validates with GPT-5, and publishes structured pages with PDF downloads.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + Cloudflare Pages
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers (Hono) + D1 + R2
- Research: Claude Sonnet 4.5 + GPT-5
- Auth: Lucia + Resend (magic links)
- Payments: Stripe (annual subscriptions)

## Context for New Agent/Session

### If You're Starting Fresh

1. **Read `docs/claude.md`** - Master plan with all links
2. **Check this file (`STATUS.md`)** - Current progress
3. **Review last todo** - See what's in progress
4. **Read relevant docs:**
   - `docs/project-structure.md` - Directory layout
   - `docs/code-standards.md` - 400-line rule
   - Component-specific docs as needed

### What NOT to Change

- Documentation structure (already complete)
- 400-line rule (enforced by design)
- Tech stack choices (documented in 00-overview.md)
- Git worktree strategy (documented in git-worktrees.md)

### What TO Focus On

- Completing monorepo setup
- Creating directory structure
- Writing package scaffolds
- Following 400-line rule strictly
- Documenting as you go (update this file!)

## Questions & Decisions Log

### Q: Why 400 lines per file?
**A:** Forces modularity, easier code review, better testability, prevents "god objects"

### Q: Why Claude 4.5 + GPT-5?
**A:** Claude 4.5 for medical synthesis (citation discipline), GPT-5 for compliance verification (variety)

### Q: Why git worktrees instead of branches?
**A:** True parallel development without branch switching, 4 agents work simultaneously

### Q: Why Cloudflare instead of Vercel/AWS?
**A:** Edge-first for latency + cost efficiency, D1/R2 integrated, generous free tier

### Q: Why annual subscriptions ($99/year)?
**A:** Lower churn, better cash flow, aligns with research update cycles

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: LLM Costs Too High
**Status:** Monitored
**Mitigation:** Batch processing, cache SourcePacks, use smaller models for simple tasks
**Details:** See `docs/09-cost-model.md`

### Risk: D1 Row Limit (100k free)
**Status:** Not Yet an Issue
**Mitigation:** Migrate to Neon Postgres at ~10k peptides
**Threshold:** Current = 0, Alert at 50k

### Risk: Context Loss Between Sessions
**Status:** Mitigated
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive documentation, this STATUS.md file
**Action:** Always update STATUS.md before ending session

---

## Cost Tracking

### One-Time Setup Costs
- Initial 20 peptides (LLM synthesis): **$80-120** (not yet incurred)

### Monthly Recurring Costs
- LLM updates (weekly, 5 peptides): **$80-120/month** (not yet incurred)
- Cloudflare infrastructure: **$0-2/month** (not yet incurred)
- Resend (email): **$0** (free tier)
- Stripe fees: **2.9% + $0.30 per transaction**

**Break-Even:** 14 subscribers @ $99/year = $1386/year ($115.50/month)
